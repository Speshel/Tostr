# What Is It?
Tostr is a project powered by a Python web server and an Android companion application (what this project is) and they communicate between each other using a service called PubNub. We have an ordinary toaster modified to detect when the toast goes down and when it pops. When either of these events occur, a message is sent to the server.

## Why?
Devyn and I were in our Internet of Things course at university and needed to come up with a project that could be created and demoed by the end of the semester. Now, we both found it difficult to get up early in the morning to catch class and thought we could design something that would automatically make some quick toast for us. That' where Tostr was born.
